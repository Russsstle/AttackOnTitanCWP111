Young Eren Yeager, of the town of Shiganshina, wishes to see the outside world by joining the Survey Corps, as he likens living in the cities to livestock. Despite this, his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and their mother Carla Yeager are against him joining the Scouts. Even after seeing the Scouts return home with large casualties, Eren expresses his interest to join which impresses his father Grisha Yeager. After Eren and Mikasa rescue their friend Armin Arlert from a group of delinquents due to his views that the walls will not protect them forever, a Titan much taller than the walls (later named the Colossal Titan) suddenly appears and knocks down the gate to Shiganshina, which lies in the outer edge of Wall Maria), allowing smaller Titans to enter. As the town erupts into mass panic, Eren and Mikasa rush to their home to find their mother pinned under their collapsed house. Carla begs them to flee, but they refuse until the city guard Hannes arrives and takes them away. Eren watches in horror as the Smiling Titan eats Carla. </td>

Some of the Shiganshina townsfolk escape to the inner Wall Maria while the soldiers try to hold off the Titans. The soldiers try to close the gate, but one of the Titans (later named the Armored Titan) rams the gate, breaching inner Wall Maria, and causing those inside to retreat even further inside Wall Rose. Some time later, Eren has a strange dream in which his grieving father forcefully gives him an injection and his key before being woken up by Mikasa. Eren grows disgusted with the people of Wall Rose as the latter do not like sharing their food or homes with the refugees. During the next year, as a food shortage becomes apparent, the government orders the refugees to either work on the farms or fight to reclaim Wall Maria. About 250,000 people, 20% of the populace choose to fight but they are wiped out by the Titans. Eren vows revenge and joins the army along with Mikasa and Armin. </td>

The recruits train on an Omni-directional Mobility Gear[1] apparatus, where they have to balance themselves while suspended on cables. After Eren has trouble balancing, he asks Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover for help and discover they too are among the few who have personally encountered Titans. The next day, Eren balances on the apparatus but falls, however Keith discovers that Eren's apparatus was defective and passes him after a retry with different equipment. </td>

As Eren prepares to attack its weak point, it inexplicably vanishes in a burst of steam. The Military Police scrambles to evacuate the people of the Trost District and set up defenses before the Titans enter the city. Eren calms Armin and Jean, who both start having nervous breakdowns due to the approaching Titans. Assigned by Commander Kitts Woerman of the Garrison to different squads, Mikasa helps with the evacuation while Eren and Armin provide backup at the front lines. Despite Mikasa's protest of wanting to stay and protect Eren, he convinces her to do her duty after promising her he will not die. With the Titans now in the city, Eren recalls his lessons that in order to kill a Titan, they must strike the nape of its neck. As Eren and Armin's squad attack, one by one their comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans, with Eren himself losing his left leg. Armin, paralyzed with fear upon seeing his comrades' fates, is picked up by a bearded Titan and almost swallowed. As Eren recalls his past, where he and Armin wished to see the world outside the walls, he manages to drag and toss Armin out of the Bearded Titan's mouth at the last moment. Eren reaches for Armin with his left arm out of the Bearded Titan's mouth, but the bearded Titan closes its jaws, severing Eren's arm and swallowing him. </td>

When Armin breaks down in tears after Connie asks what happened to his squad, Ymir correctly deduces that they are all dead. As Armin heads back to the rear guard, he blames himself for being weak and not saving Eren. Meanwhile, a greedy merchant tries to force his cargo into the city's exit gate and refuses to allow the refugees to go first. As the crowd grows impatient, an Abnormal Titan suddenly approaches but is killed by Mikasa right before it can reach the crowd. When she realizes the merchant is the cause of the holdup at the gate, she threatens him into moving his cargo for the refugees. As she is thanked by a mother and daughter, Mikasa has a flashback. In the year 844, a year before the fall of Wall Maria, Mikasa is targeted by slave traders, who murder her parents in a struggle. After Grisha and Eren discover the dead bodies while making a visit, Grisha orders Eren to return home. Instead, Eren tracks down the slave traders to a nearby hut and kills two of them in an attempt to save Mikasa. However, the third slave trader appears and begins strangling Eren, who tells Mikasa to kill the man if she wants to live, which she does after overcoming her fear and gaining resolve. Eventually, the children are found by the Military Police. As Mikasa cries that she has no home to go back to, she is invited to live with Grisha and Eren, who gives her a red scarf to wear. Back in the present, Mikasa slays more Titans and goes to help the other squads evacuate. </td>

Mikasa ends up running out of gas mid-air and falls into an alleyway, leading Jean to assume command. However, he loses his nerve when he sees some of his comrades being eaten by Titans. As a blonde Titan approaches Mikasa, she at first accepts her fate but instinctively starts fighting back after remembering Eren's words of perseverance. As she prepares to attack with her only remaining broken blade, another Titan appears behind her and brutally kills the blonde Titan, much to her confusion. Armin and Connie show up, and they are all shocked to see the Rogue Titan not only fighting other Titans, but also showing knowledge of their weak point and using hand-to-hand combat techniques, while completely ignoring the humans. Armin gives Mikasa his gas tanks and blades so that she can support the others at the supply depot. Mikasa, however, refuses to leave him behind and ponders on the Rogue Titan's strange behavior. </td>

His rage at the Titans caused him to burst out of the bearded Titan's stomach by transforming into a Titan himself and going on a rampage against them. To Eren's confusion when regaining consciousness, Kitts's men aim their weapons at him.

However, Kitts also witnessed this and has his men corner Eren, but Armin and Mikasa defend him. Kitts accuses Eren of actually being a Titan in disguise, but Eren has no memories of becoming a Titan or how his limbs grew back. Even though Eren claims he is human, Kitts fearfully orders the cannons to fire on the three of them. As they try to escape, Eren recalls hazy memories of his father giving him an injection, telling him to reclaim Wall Maria and go to their home's basement with his key.

								<td colspan="8">When word spreads about a Titan siding with humankind, the populace is divided over whether Eren is their savior or their end. Eren is brought to a military tribunal to be judged by Commander-in-Chief Darius Zackly, who will decide whether Eren should be given to the Military Police or the Survey Corps, both of whom have their own reasons for wanting him. The Military Police wants Eren killed as he is seen by them as a menace, while the Survey Corps wants to use him to retake Wall Maria. As both sides get into heated arguments over Eren's Titan powers, one of the merchants siding with the Military Police accuses Mikasa of being a Titan as well, much to Eren's anger. When Eren calls out the Military Police and their supporters for their cowardice, one of them prepares to shoot him, only for Levi to beat Eren down. Despite being brutally beaten, he does not transform into a Titan, which Levi uses to show to the court that the Survey Corps can control Eren, and proposes that he is to be made part of his squad. In the end, Zackly gives Eren to the Survey Corps where Erwin and Hange Zoë welcome him. As Eren is getting treatment for his wounds, they discover that he grew back a tooth knocked out during Levi's beating. </td>

As Levi orders the castle to be cleaned, Petra assures Eren that despite his rude and harsh demeanor, Levi does care about the people under his command. Meanwhile, Erwin and Mike Zacharias discuss the new recruits joining the Survey Corps and how they must prove Eren's usefulness to Military Command within a month. While discussing his powers with Levi's squad, Hange arrives and asks Eren to help her in her experiments with the two Titans they have captured, which she named Sawney and Beane. Hange is revealed to have an obsession with Titans where she treats them like people despite the many times she puts herself in danger. During her all night talks with Eren, she reveals that the Titans need sunlight to survive and their bodies are disproportionately light despite their size. But the next day, the Survey Corps discover Sawney and Beane have been killed. As Hange mourns for them, the Survey Corps deduce that the culprit is a soldier who escaped using their Omni-directional Mobility Gear, which makes Eren wonder who their true enemy is. </td>

The Female Titan captures Armin but after removing his hood and seeing his face, she leaves him alive and continues running. Armin is picked up by Reiner and Jean, who reveals that their right flank was wiped out by the Titans, which makes Armin realize it was the Female Titan's work and she is possibly another Titan Shifter like Eren.

The squad apologized to Eren and told him they should trust each other. Remembering this, Eren decides to trust his squad's plan.

As the Scouts prepare to set off for Trost, Reiner takes Eren aside and casually reveals that he is the Armored Titan, Bertholdt is the Colossal Titan, and that their mission to destroy all of humanity can be avoided if Eren would simply come with them. The episode flashes back to 12 hours earlier in Ehrmich District where Hange explains that the scroll she received earlier from Sasha contained a background report on Annie which suggests a connection with Reiner and Bertholdt, as all three are from the same area but otherwise have little background information available. After reaching into their memories of Reiner and Bertholdt, they begin to suspect that they may have helped Annie find Eren's location within the formation during the 57th Expedition. Hange therefore orders everyone to keep an eye on Reiner and Bertholdt without raising undue suspicion. Back in the present, Reiner and Bertholdt both shift into their respective Titan forms despite a quick intervention by Mikasa. The Armored Titan grabs Eren and heads down the wall as the Colossal Titan grabs Ymir. Feeling betrayed, an angry Eren shifts into his Titan form and begins to fight the Armored Titan. </td>

Hange orders the Scouts to attack the slow-moving Colossal Titan after it "eats" Ymir and another Scout, but it releases an enormous amount of steam, wounding several Scouts and preventing further attacks. Meanwhile, the Armored Titan gains the upper hand in his fight against Eren, and despite the best efforts of Mikasa to help, the situation seems desperate. Fortunately, Eren remembers the hand-to-hand techniques taught to him by Annie during their training and he begins to seriously damage the Armored Titan. Armin implores Eren to fall back to the wall for his own safety, and much to everyone's surprise, he obliges. Hannes' patrol returns, and Hannes is shocked to see the Colossal Titan, not to mention Eren's Titan Form as well as the Armored Titan. The latter charges at Eren once more, who again utilizes grapple techniques to overcome his strength disadvantage and regain the upper hand. With the encouragement of his comrades, he is nearly successful at beheading the Armored Titan and extracting Reiner from within, only to be foiled when the Armored Titan roars for assistance. To the Scout's horror, the Colossal Titan begins to deteriorate and plummets towards Eren and the Armored Titan. </td>

Bertholdt, carrying the still unconscious Ymir, uses stolen 3DMG to leave with the Armored Titan. The blast seriously injures many of the Scouts, including Mikasa and Hange. Several hours later in Trost District, Commander Pyxis, Erwin, Jean, and the other military forces are informed about the battle with the Colossal and Armored Titans as well as the capture of Eren and Ymir. Back at the walls, Armin watches over the unconscious Mikasa. While unconscious, Mikasa has a dream about the past, wherein she rescued Eren from the neighborhood bullies. She wakes, and is distraught to find that Eren is gone. There is nothing they can do about it in their current state, but Hannes gives a rousing speech reminding them of Eren's steadfast resolve, and vows to help them rescue Eren. Erwin soon arrives with reinforcements. Hange, now awake, posits that Reiner and Bertholdt may seek the relative safety of a nearby Forest of Giant Trees to rest until nightfall, assuming their goal is to relocate outside of Wall Maria. Eren and Ymir are shown waking in the forest as their bodies begin to regenerate their missing and damaged limbs while Reiner and Bertholdt watch over them.

She points out that they are they deep within Titan territory, surrounded by Titans, weakened from their earlier battle, and only Reiner and Bertholdt possess 3DMG. When questioned, Reiner says that they are taking them to their hometown, and are waiting until nightfall, when the surrounding Titans cannot move. Eren remains unconvinced, but Ymir reminds him that they are not in a position to fight until they regenerate. Reiner begins to ramble about his duty as a soldier and warrior, which Ymir figures indicates confusion between his undercover and real personas. This infuriates Eren, who confronts Reiner and Bertholdt about the death and destruction they have caused as Titans. Ymir however, is more concerned about the ape-like Titan that caused the recent Titan invasion and who may be their real enemy. Reiner then uses Ymir's concern for Christa's safety as leverage to drive a wedge between Ymir and Eren. The discussion is interrupted by the sound of flare guns, signalling the arrival of the Scouts, which angers Reiner and Bertholdt. </td>

At the Forest of Giant Trees, Reiner continues to press Ymir to join them, but she'll only help if they agree to take Christa with them. In a flashback to Ymir's childhood, she is taken in and worshiped by a cult, who insist she has royal blood. She lives this lie until the cult is apprehended by soldiers, who punish the cultists and Ymir by injecting them with something and throwing them off a wall, resulting in them Titan Shifting. Ymir then spends the next 60 years as a Titan, only to happen upon Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, and their friend Marcel. Marcel saves Reiner, but is eaten by Ymir, allowing her to return to human form. She realizes the freedom she felt in accepting who she was instead of living a lie was why she developed such empathy with Christa. Returning to the present, Ymir convinces Reiner and Bertholdt to allow her to Titan Shift and take Christa with them. When the 104th Trainees enter the forest, Titan Ymir singles out Christa and envelops her in her mouth before rejoining Reiner and Bertholdt.

Curiously, as Hange gets the Titan to chase after her, it suddenly retreats to the forest. Hange follows it to the center of the forest, where she finds it banging its head against a certain tree. The Titan turns hostile when Hange gets close to it, but Levi and the others arrive and kill it, much to Hange's dismay. Upon inspecting the scene, they discover the decapitated body of Ilse Langnar, a soldier from the 34th Recon Corps division, resting inside of the tree, and find a notebook belonging to her lying on the ground. The notebook details Ilse's records, as she escaped on foot after her squad was killed by Titans. She eventually became cornered by a Titan, but instead of killing her right away, it started to speak to her in the human language, calling her "Ymir". Ilse attempted to communicate with the Titan, but it inevitably became hostile again and bit off her head, curiously choosing not to devour her body but instead rest it inside the tree. Having read through all of Ilse's notes, Hange uses the notebook as leverage to convince Erwin to approve of operations to capture Titans alive and study them, before returning Ilse's belongings to her grief-stricken family. </td>
